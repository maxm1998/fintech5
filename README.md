# Fintech Intro

## Hi my name is Max Miorada.
 I am 23 and Have a background in mortgage finance, and a deep interest in Economics.

My career Goals are to develop an autonomous lending system the allows every day people exposure to lending and finance with digital asset collateralisation, in a centralised maner. This allows people to gain important finance for things such as a house or car, without liquidating assets, and with the assurance / insurance that their assets are safe.

This will then give me the opportunity to branch further in to financial services industry in relevance to digital assets and currency


I am also deeply involved and passionate about finance, and have a keen interest about technology. i look to use the 2 together to be innovative and achieve my goals, and bring my ideas to life.

 
Blockfi is a company in which is doing something similar to a what i envision possible here in Australia.
